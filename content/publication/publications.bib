Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible to surpass the acoustic diffraction limit by analyzing fluctuations in a set of photoacoustic images obtained under unknown speckle illumination patterns. Here, we purpose an approach to boost reconstruction fidelity and resolution, while reducing the number of acquired images by utilizing a compressed sensing computational reconstruction framework. The approach takes into account prior knowledge of the system response and sparsity of the target structure. We provide proof of principle experiments of the approach and demonstrate that improved performance is obtained when both speckle fluctuations and object priors are used. We numerically study the expected performance as a function of the measurement’s signal to noise ratio and sample spatial-sparsity. The presented reconstruction framework can be applied to analyze existing photoacoustic experimental data sets containing dynamic fluctuations.},

Light can be focused through inhomogeneous media into any desired point with wavefront shaping techniques. However, scattering correlations, referred to as the optical memory effect, limit spatial range within the scattering medium, where a single wavefront correction remains accurate. Selecting only the weakly scattered light is a promising way to increase this correlation range. Here we investigate spatial scattering correlations by digitally time-gating the early arriving light in the spectral domain. We demonstrate that the range of the translational memory effect for the early arriving light is increased almost fourfold, paving the way for a range of scattering media imaging applications.},

Therefore, higher spatial resolutions can be achieved using Fabry-P\&\#x00E9;rot cavity sensors than conventional piezoelectric detection. However, fabrication constraints during the deposition of the sensing polymer layer require precise control of the interrogation beam wavelength to provide optimal sensitivity. This is commonly achieved by employing slowly tunable narrowband lasers as interrogation sources, hence limiting the acquisition speed. We propose instead to use a broadband source and a fast-tunable acousto-optic filter to adjust the interrogation wavelength at each pixel within a few microseconds. We demonstrate the validity of this approach by performing photoacoustic imaging with a highly inhomogeneous Fabry-P\&\#x00E9;rot sensor.},

	abstract = {Locating sound sources such as prey or predators is critical for survival in many vertebrates. Terrestrial vertebrates locate sources by measuring the time delay and intensity difference of sound pressure at each ear1–5. Underwater, however, the physics of sound makes interaural cues very small, suggesting that directional hearing in fish should be nearly impossible6. Yet, directional hearing has been confirmed behaviourally, although the mechanisms have remained unknown for decades. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this remarkable ability, including the possibility that fish evolved an extreme sensitivity to minute interaural differences or that fish might compare sound pressure with particle motion signals7,8. However, experimental challenges have long hindered a definitive explanation. Here we empirically test these models in the transparent teleost Danionella cerebrum, one of the smallest vertebrates9,10. By selectively controlling pressure and particle motion, we dissect the sensory algorithm underlying directional acoustic startles. We find that both cues are indispensable for this behaviour and that their relative phase controls its direction. Using micro-computed tomography and optical vibrometry, we further show that D. cerebrum has the sensory structures to implement this mechanism. D. cerebrum shares these structures with more than 15\% of living vertebrate species, suggesting a widespread mechanism for inferring sound direction.},

	abstract = {High-resolution ultrasound based imaging techniques like photoacoustic (PA) imaging that require fast detection of acoustic waves, are often coupled with an opto-mechanical sensor like a Fabry–Pérot cavity (FPC) for enhanced sensitivity at high frequency. Due to the inherent inhomogeneity of the FPC thickness, the resonance of the cavity can exhibit a spatial distribution, requiring dynamic adjustment of the interrogation wavelength when raster-scanning the sensor with a probe beam. To avoid this, we propose in this work the use of an electro-optically modulated dual-comb light source for rapid acoustic wave sensing within a specified bandwidth. Utilizing a dual-comb vibrometry approach, we demonstrated a proof-of-principle of the technique, with real-time detection of 10 MHz acoustic waves simultaneously with three different teeth (separated by 10 GHz) of the dual-frequency comb, achieving a 20 ns temporal resolution. We also investigated the system’s sensitivity limit in terms of the strength of the detected acoustic waves, opening new possibilities for ultrafast PA imaging modalities.},
