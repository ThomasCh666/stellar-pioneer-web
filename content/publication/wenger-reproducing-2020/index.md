abstract: Is there a bright spot in the shadow of an opaque disk? Nearly 200 years
  ago, Augustin Fresnel and François Arago’s remarkable answer to this question validated
  the wave theory of light and inaugurated the modern theories of diffraction. Today,
  their renowned experiment can be easily reproduced using lasers and cameras. Far
  beyond its historical interest, the experiment is a versatile platform to illustrate
  the main concepts of optical physics, including diffraction, interference, speckle,
  and Fourier optics.
