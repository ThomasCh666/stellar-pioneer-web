abstract: In deep tissue photoacoustic imaging the spatial resolution is inherently
  limited by the acoustic wavelength. Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible
  to surpass the acoustic diffraction limit by analyzing fluctuations in a set of
  photoacoustic images obtained under unknown speckle illumination patterns. Here,
  we purpose an approach to boost reconstruction fidelity and resolution, while reducing
  the number of acquired images by utilizing a compressed sensing computational reconstruction
  framework. The approach takes into account prior knowledge of the system response
  and sparsity of the target structure. We provide proof of principle experiments
  of the approach and demonstrate that improved performance is obtained when both
  speckle fluctuations and object priors are used. We numerically study the expected
  performance as a function of the measurementâ€™s signal to noise ratio and sample
  spatial-sparsity. The presented reconstruction framework can be applied to analyze
  existing photoacoustic experimental data sets containing dynamic fluctuations.
