abstract: Locating sound sources such as prey or predators is critical for survival
  in many vertebrates. Terrestrial vertebrates locate sources by measuring the time
  delay and intensity difference of sound pressure at each ear1–5. Underwater, however,
  the physics of sound makes interaural cues very small, suggesting that directional
  hearing in fish should be nearly impossible6. Yet, directional hearing has been
  confirmed behaviourally, although the mechanisms have remained unknown for decades.
  Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this remarkable ability, including
  the possibility that fish evolved an extreme sensitivity to minute interaural differences
  or that fish might compare sound pressure with particle motion signals7,8. However,
  experimental challenges have long hindered a definitive explanation. Here we empirically
  test these models in the transparent teleost Danionella cerebrum, one of the smallest
  vertebrates9,10. By selectively controlling pressure and particle motion, we dissect
  the sensory algorithm underlying directional acoustic startles. We find that both
  cues are indispensable for this behaviour and that their relative phase controls
  its direction. Using micro-computed tomography and optical vibrometry, we further
  show that D. cerebrum has the sensory structures to implement this mechanism. D. cerebrum
  shares these structures with more than 15% of living vertebrate species, suggesting
  a widespread mechanism for inferring sound direction.
