 abstract = {The last decade has seen the development of a wide set of tools, such as wavefront shaping, computational or fundamental methods, that allow to understand and control light propagation in a complex medium, such as biological tissues or multimode fibers. A vibrant and diverse community is now working on this field, that has revolutionized the prospect of diffraction-limited imaging at depth in tissues. This roadmap highlights several key aspects of this fast developing field, and some of the challenges and opportunities ahead.},
