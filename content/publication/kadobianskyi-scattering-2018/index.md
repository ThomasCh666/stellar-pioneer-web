abstract: Manipulating the propagation of light through scattering media remains a
  major challenge for many applications, including astronomy, biomedical imaging,
  and colloidal optics. Light can be focused through inhomogeneous media into any
  desired point with wavefront shaping techniques. However, scattering correlations,
  referred to as the optical memory effect, limit spatial range within the scattering
  medium, where a single wavefront correction remains accurate. Selecting only the
  weakly scattered light is a promising way to increase this correlation range. Here
  we investigate spatial scattering correlations by digitally time-gating the early
  arriving light in the spectral domain. We demonstrate that the range of the translational
  memory effect for the early arriving light is increased almost fourfold, paving
  the way for a range of scattering media imaging applications.
