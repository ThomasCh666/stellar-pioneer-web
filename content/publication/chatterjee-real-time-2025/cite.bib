 abstract = {High-resolution ultrasound based imaging techniques like photoacoustic (PA) imaging that require fast detection of acoustic waves, are often coupled with an opto-mechanical sensor like a Fabry–Pérot cavity (FPC) for enhanced sensitivity at high frequency. Due to the inherent inhomogeneity of the FPC thickness, the resonance of the cavity can exhibit a spatial distribution, requiring dynamic adjustment of the interrogation wavelength when raster-scanning the sensor with a probe beam. To avoid this, we propose in this work the use of an electro-optically modulated dual-comb light source for rapid acoustic wave sensing within a specified bandwidth. Utilizing a dual-comb vibrometry approach, we demonstrated a proof-of-principle of the technique, with real-time detection of 10 MHz acoustic waves simultaneously with three different teeth (separated by 10 GHz) of the dual-frequency comb, achieving a 20 ns temporal resolution. We also investigated the system’s sensitivity limit in terms of the strength of the detected acoustic waves, opening new possibilities for ultrafast PA imaging modalities.},
