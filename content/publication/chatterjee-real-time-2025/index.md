abstract: High-resolution ultrasound based imaging techniques like photoacoustic (PA)
  imaging that require fast detection of acoustic waves, are often coupled with an
  opto-mechanical sensor like a Fabry–Pérot cavity (FPC) for enhanced sensitivity
  at high frequency. Due to the inherent inhomogeneity of the FPC thickness, the resonance
  of the cavity can exhibit a spatial distribution, requiring dynamic adjustment of
  the interrogation wavelength when raster-scanning the sensor with a probe beam.
  To avoid this, we propose in this work the use of an electro-optically modulated
  dual-comb light source for rapid acoustic wave sensing within a specified bandwidth.
  Utilizing a dual-comb vibrometry approach, we demonstrated a proof-of-principle
  of the technique, with real-time detection of 10 MHz acoustic waves simultaneously
  with three different teeth (separated by 10 GHz) of the dual-frequency comb, achieving
  a 20 ns temporal resolution. We also investigated the system’s sensitivity limit
  in terms of the strength of the detected acoustic waves, opening new possibilities
  for ultrafast PA imaging modalities.
