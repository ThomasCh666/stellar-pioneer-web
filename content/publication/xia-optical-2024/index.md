abstract: Over the past decade, optical wavefront shaping has been developed to focus
  light through highly opaque scattering layers, opening new possibilities for biomedical
  applications. To probe light intensity deep inside soft scattering media such as
  biological tissues, internal guide-stars are required. Here, we give an overview
  of the main principles and describe in depth the use of a photoacoustic feedback
  signal for this purpose. We further present first principles calculations and simulations
  to estimate important experimental parameters, and detailed instructions on designing
  and conducting these experiments. Finally, we provide guidance towards selecting
  suitable equipment for building a typical experimental setup, paving the way for
  further innovative biomedical imaging and therapy applications.
