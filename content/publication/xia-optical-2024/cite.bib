 abstract = {Over the past decade, optical wavefront shaping has been developed to focus light through highly opaque scattering layers, opening new possibilities for biomedical applications. To probe light intensity deep inside soft scattering media such as biological tissues, internal guide-stars are required. Here, we give an overview of the main principles and describe in depth the use of a photoacoustic feedback signal for this purpose. We further present first principles calculations and simulations to estimate important experimental parameters, and detailed instructions on designing and conducting these experiments. Finally, we provide guidance towards selecting suitable equipment for building a typical experimental setup, paving the way for further innovative biomedical imaging and therapy applications.},
