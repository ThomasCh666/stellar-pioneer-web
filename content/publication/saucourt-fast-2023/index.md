abstract: Optical detection of ultrasound for photoacoustic imaging provides a large
  bandwidth and high sensitivity at high acoustic frequencies. Therefore, higher spatial
  resolutions can be achieved using Fabry-P&#x00E9;rot cavity sensors than conventional
  piezoelectric detection. However, fabrication constraints during the deposition
  of the sensing polymer layer require precise control of the interrogation beam wavelength
  to provide optimal sensitivity. This is commonly achieved by employing slowly tunable
  narrowband lasers as interrogation sources, hence limiting the acquisition speed.
  We propose instead to use a broadband source and a fast-tunable acousto-optic filter
  to adjust the interrogation wavelength at each pixel within a few microseconds.
  We demonstrate the validity of this approach by performing photoacoustic imaging
  with a highly inhomogeneous Fabry-P&#x00E9;rot sensor.
